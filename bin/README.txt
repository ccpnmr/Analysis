  ========

Welcome to Analysis.
Please ensure that the release directory is in the root of your account, i.e. as $HOME/release

The Analysis program is run from the release/ccpnmr3.0.b2/bin directory

  cd ~/release/ccpnmr3.0.b2/bin/
  ./assign

If you have any errors when first running the program, please try the following:
change to the /bin directory

  cd ~/release/ccpnmr3.0.b2/bin/

and run the firstInstall script:

  ./firstInstall

which should modify the paths in the miniconda install to point to your home directory
