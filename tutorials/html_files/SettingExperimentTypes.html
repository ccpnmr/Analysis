<h2>Setting Experiment Types</h2>
<p>Analysis no longer asks you to set an experiment type when you open a spectrum, but you can set the experiment type at any time. Simply <span class="action">double-click</span> on a spectrum in the sidebar. This will bring up the <span class="action">Spectrum Properties</span> dialog in which you can select the <span class="action">Experiment Type</span> from a drop-down menu. If you want to set the experiment type for lots of experiments at the same time, you can type <span class="action">ET</span> which will bring up a dialog box in which you can specify the experiment types of all your spectra.</p>
<p>Often it is not necessary to set your experiment types, but it may be required for some data analysis or assignment routines. It also means the program can help reduce your peak assignment options in some instances, e.g. because it knows that two dimensions must have directly bonded NmrAtoms or that a particular spectrum can only contain intra-residue peaks.</p>
<p>All the experiment types previously available in V2.4, covering both solution and solid-state NMR, continue to be available.</p>
