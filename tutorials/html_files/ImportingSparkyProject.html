<h2>Importing a Sparky Project</h2>
<p>Analysis V3 contains a simple Sparky importer. Since Sparky projects don't always follow a completely standard setup, we cannot guarantee that your project will be imported correctly, but hopefully most of your data will be transferred into CcpNmr AnalysisAssign V3 correctly.</p>
<p>You can import a Sparky project by dragging your Sparky .proj file into the Drop Area.</p>
<h2>Changing Amino Acid Types from 1-letter to 3-letter code</h2>
<p>Amino acid types in Sparky projects are often given in one-letter code. Analysis, by contrast, uses uppercase three-letter code (IUPAC and NEF convention). In order for Analysis to recognise your assignment correctly, your assignments must contain the amino acids in three letter code. We have included a simple macro which will allow you to convert your amino acid names. Go to <span class="action">Macro/Open</span> and open the <span class="action">Convert123LetterAACode.py</span> file in the <span class="action">XXX/YYY</span> directory. Click <span class="action">Run</span> to run the macro.</p>
