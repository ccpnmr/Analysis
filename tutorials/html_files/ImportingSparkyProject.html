<h2>Importing a Sparky Project</h2>
<p>Analysis V3 contains a simple Sparky importer. Since Sparky projects don't always follow a completely standard setup, we cannot guarantee that your project will be imported fully, but hopefully most of your data will be transferred into CcpNmr AnalysisAssign V3 correctly.</p>
<p>You can import a Sparky project by <span class="action">dragging & dropping</span> a Sparky .proj file into the Drop Area. You can also <span class="action">drag & drop</span> one or more Sparky .save files into Analysis.</p>
<h2>Changing Amino Acid Types from 1-letter to 3-letter code</h2>
<p>Amino acid types in Sparky projects are often given in one-letter code. Analysis, by contrast, uses uppercase three-letter code (IUPAC and NEF convention). In order for Analysis to recognise your assignment correctly, your assignments must contain the amino acids in three letter code. We have included a simple macro which will allow you to convert your amino acid names. To run the macro, go to <span class="action">Macro/CCPN Macros</span> and select <span class="action">Convert123LetterAACode</span>.</p>
<h3>Moving Peak Assignments into a single NmrChain</h3>
<p>Depending on the setup of your Sparky project you may find that you have lots of different NmrChains in your Analysis project - one for each spectrum and one for the resonance list. You will encounter the same situation if you have imported several .save files. You can move all your NmrResidues into a single chain using a macro. Go to <span class="action">Macro/CCPN Macros</span> and select <span class="action">NameOfMacro</span> to run the macro.</p>
<h3>Known issues</h3>
<p>November 2019 - we are aware of several issues which may cause problems when importing a Sparky project. For example, the presence of 'QB'-style pseudoatoms will prevent the project from opening and peak lists are not always imported correctly. We are working on fixes to these issues.</p>
