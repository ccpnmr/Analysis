<h2>Customise Spectrum Display</h2>
<h3>Background Colour</h3>
<p>You can set the background of your spectra to be either white or black. Go to <span class="action">Project / Preferences ...</span> or type <span class="action">Ctrl/Cmd ,</span> and in the <span class="action">General</span> tab you can select your Colour scheme to be either <span class="action">light</span> (for a white background) or <span class="action">dark</span> for a black background. Axis/mouse colours and contour colours for newly loaded spectra will adjust automatically.</p>
<h3>Contours</h3>
<p>You can adjust the contour levels of a spectrum using the <span class="action">Contours Up/Down</span> buttons in the toolbar. To set the contour levels manually, either <span class="action">double-click</span> on a spectrum in the sidebar and go to the <span class="action">Contours</span> tab in the <span class="action">Spectrum Properties</span> dialog box, or <span class="action">right-click</span> in your spectrum and select <span class="action">Contours ...</span> to set the contours for all spectra in that display.
<br>The Contours diaglog lets you set the contour base levels manually. You can also set the multiplier; this determines how close to one another the contours are drawn. Go for 1.1-1.2 to make them very close, or 1.6-1.8 to separate them out more. You can also change the number and colour of the contours and select whether or not to show the positive/negative contours.</p>
<p>If you have multiple spectra in one display, you can switch the spectra on/off using the buttons in the spectrum toolbar. You can show/hide the spectrum toolbar by typing <span class="action">SB</span> or <span class="action">right-clicking</span> and toggling <span class="action">Spectrum Toolbar</span> on/off. (You can hide the main toolbar with <span class="action">TB</span> or <span class="action">right-click / Toolbar</span>.)
<br>You can remove a spectrum of a display by <span class="action">right-clicking</span> on the spectrum botton in the toolbar and selecting <span class="action">Remove Spectrum</span>.</p>
