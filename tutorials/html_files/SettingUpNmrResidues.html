<h2>Setting up NmrResidues</h2>
<p>Setting up your NmrResidues is the first step required for the Backbone Assignment of a protein. We start the assignment process by assigning each peak to NmrResidues and NmrAtoms which we use as placeholders until (over the course of the assignment process) we can assign them to actual residues and atoms. Go to <a href="">NmrResidues</a> for more information on how NmrResidues, NmrAtoms and NmrChains are used in Analysis.</p>
<p>First of all set the experiment type for your base spectrum (usually a <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC) - go to <a href="">Setting Experiment Types</a> find out how to do this.</p>
<p>Make sure all the peaks have been picked (go to <a href="">Peak Picking</a> for more information on how to do this).</p>
<p>Type <span class="action">SN</span> or go to <span class="action">Assignment / Set up NmrResidues</span>. Select the (HSQC) peak list you want to use to set up your NmrResidues. Select the NmrChain you would like your NmrResidues to be added to. By default this is the <span class="action">@-</span> chain. If you want to use a different NmrChain, you can create a new one, by opening up <span class="action">NmrChains</span> in the sidebar and <span class="action">double-clicking</span> on <span class="action">New NmrChain</span>. Then select <span class="action">Create New</span> (rather than <span class="action">Clone from</span>) and give your NmrChain a name. Once you have selected both your source peak list and your NmrChain you can click <span class="action">Okay</span> to set up your NmrResidues. Each peak will now be labelled with an NmrResidue and with NmrAtoms appropriate to the spectrum you are using (<span class="action">H</span> and <span class="action">N</span> in the case of an HSQC). If you open your NmrChain in the sidebar you will now see that it contains all the NmrResidues and these in turn contain the NmrAtoms that have just been created. These are now your provisional atoms names until you have managed to assign them. Any other peaks in other spectra which stem from the same nuclei can be assigned to these same NmrAtoms.</p>
