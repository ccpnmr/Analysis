<h2>Backbone Assignment</h2>
<p>Once you have <a href="https://www.ccpn.ac.uk/forums/misc.php?action=help&hid=37">Set up your NmrResidues</a> and finished the <a href="https://www.ccpn.ac.uk/forums/misc.php?action=help&hid=50">Pick and Assign</a> routine, you are ready to sequentially link your residues and then sequence-specifically assign them. This is done using the Backbone Assignment routine.</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>Open three spectrum display modules next to one another in your drop area: one containing your HSQC and two containing your 3D assignment spectra (e.g. HNCACB/CBCACONH and/or HNCA/HNCOCA). Open the Backbone Assignment module with <span class="action">BB</span> or via <span class="action">Assign / Backbone Assignment</span>. Select your NmrChain in the drop-down menu (probably the <span class="action">@-</span> NmrChain). Then open the settings box by <span class="action">left-clicking</span> on the <span class="action">gear icon</span>. Here you can select your Match module which should be one of your 3D spectrum displays. A good use of space is to place the Backbone Assignment module underneath your HSQC spectrum display.</p>
<p>Now open the sequence graph with <span class="action">SG</span> or via <span class="action">View / Sequence Graph</span>. This module contains two sections. The lower part shows the protein sequence. The upper part shows the NmrResidues for the NmrChain selected in the drop-down menu. Underneath the NmrResidues you should see amino acid type predictions (these will be more accurate if you have assigned CB as well as CA NmrAtoms). If you have specified experiment types for your spectra, then you will see colour-coded lines that show which NmrAtoms are linked through peaks in the your various spectra. You don't strictly need to set experiment types in order to do the backbone assignment, but it can be a helpful way to check for mistakes. Go to <a href="https://www.ccpn.ac.uk/forums/misc.php?action=help&hid=34">Setting Experiment Types</a> and Backbone Assignment: Finding and correcting mistakes for more information.</p>
<h3>Linking in the i+1 direction</h3>
<p>Begin your backbone assignment by double-clicking on an NmrResidue, e.g. <span class="action">@100</span>, in the Backbone Assignment module. Your HSQC and one of the 3D spectrum displays will navigate now navigate to this NmrResidue position and the NmrResidue Project ID (PID) will be shown in the strip header. The @100 CA and CB chemical shifts will be marked. In your match display you will see three possible matches.</p>
