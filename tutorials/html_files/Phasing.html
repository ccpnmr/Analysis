<h2>Phasing Spectra</h2>
<p>You can open the phasing console using <span class="action">right-click / Enter Phasing Console</span> or by typing <span class="action">PC</span>. Select 1D traces with <span class="action">right-click / Add Trace</span> or by typing <span class="action">TA</span>. You can remove all traces again with <span class="action">right-click / Remove All Traces</span> or <span class="action">TR</span>. To change the scaling of the traces either use the buttons in the toolbar, <span class="action">TU</span> and <span class="action">TD</span> for 'Trace Up' and 'Trace Down' or use the commands in the right-hand mouse menu. The position of the pivot is indicated by a dashed black line and by default it is set in the middle of the spectrum. You can place this elsewhere either by <span class="action">left-dragging</span> the pivot line, by placing the mouse at the desired pivot point and typing <span class="action">PV</span> or doing <span class="action">right-click / Set Pivot</span>.
