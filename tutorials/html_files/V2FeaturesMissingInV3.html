<h2>V2 features missing in V3</h2>
<p>There are a number of features in V2.4 which we have not yet implemented in V3. We are working on this, though! Our aim is not only to replicate, but to improve and expand features as we implement them.</p>
<h3>Tiles / separators in spectrum displays</h3>
<p>Coming soon!</p>
<h3>Assignment Graph</h3>
<p>V3 does have the Sequence Graph which is similar, but doesn't include as many features. Currently, the Sequence Graph module has several speed issues and we may decide to redesign this completely.</p>
<h3>Reference Chemical Shifts</h3>
<p>Although you can view these with <span class="action">RC</span>, the graphs are currently not as interactive and do not show a cursor linked to the other spectrum windows.</p>
<h3>Synthetic peak lists</h3>
<p>It is currently possible to create a synthetic peak list when importing a BMRB file (see <a href="https://www.ccpn.ac.uk/forums/misc.php?action=help&hid=60">BMRB Import</a>), but not from a chemical shift list or pdb file (unless you try writing your own macro).</p>
<h3>Follow Intensity Changes</h3>
<h3>Follow Shift Changes</h3>
<h3>Shift Differences</h3>
<h3>Heteronuclear NOE analysis</h3>
<h3>Analysis of 3J H-Ha Couplings</h3>
<h3>Initialise Amide Side-Chains</h3>
<h3>Secondary Structure Chart</h3>
<h3>Quality Reports</h3>
<h3>Residue Interaction Matrix</h3>
<h3>Structure related features</h3>
<p>It is possible to read in pdb files and restraint data from NEF files, but otherwise few structure-related features are implemented as yet.</p>
<h3>Isotope Labelling</h3>
<p>At the moment we have no plans to include this in V3, as it does not appear to be used much. If you think this is important, then please do contact us to discuss this.</p>
