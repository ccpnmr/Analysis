<h2>Popular V2 Features in V3</h2>
<p>As we implement popular V2 features in V3, we are aiming not just to replicate them, but to improve and expand them as well. Of course, this takes time and not all V2 features are yet implemented in V3, but we are working on this!</p>
<h3>Tiles / separators in spectrum displays</h3>
<p>Coming to V3 soon!</p>
<h3>Assignment Graph</h3>
<p>V3 has the Sequence Graph which is similar to the V2 assignment graph, but doesn't include as many features. Currently, the Sequence Graph module has several speed issues and we may yet decide to redesign this completely.</p>
<h3>Reference Chemical Shifts</h3>
<p>You can view these with <span class="action">RC</span>, but the graphs are not yet as interactive as in V2 and do not show a cursor linked to the other spectrum windows. Our intention is to expand the capabilities, so that you can eventually add your own reference data. E.g. if you are working with intrinsically disordered proteins, you could import a different set of reference chemical shifts suitable to these types of proteins.</p>
<h3>Synthetic peak lists</h3>
<p>It is currently possible to create a synthetic peak list when importing a BMRB file (see <a href="https://www.ccpn.ac.uk/forums/misc.php?action=help&hid=60">BMRB Import</a>), but not from a chemical shift list or pdb file (unless you try writing your own macro).</p>
<h3>Follow Intensity Changes</h3>
<h3>Follow Shift Changes</h3>
<h3>Shift Differences</h3>
<h3>Heteronuclear NOE analysis</h3>
<h3>Analysis of 3J H-Ha Couplings</h3>
<h3>Initialise Amide Side-Chains</h3>
<h3>Secondary Structure Chart</h3>
<h3>Quality Reports</h3>
<h3>Residue Interaction Matrix</h3>
<h3>Structure related features</h3>
<p>It is possible to read in pdb files and restraint data from NEF files, but otherwise few structure-related features are implemented as yet.</p>
<h3>Isotope Labelling</h3>
<p>At the moment we have no plans to include this in V3, as it does not appear to be used much. If you think this is important, then please do contact us to discuss this.</p>
