<h2>Importing V2 Projects</h2>
<p>CcpNmr Analysis V2 projects are converted to V3 on the fly. This means that you can simply <span class="action">drag and drop</span> a version 2 project folder from your computer's file browser into V3 of Analysis and it will open automatically. Alternatively, go to <span class="action">Project / Open ...</span> and select the V2 project folder you wish to open. For larger projects you might have to wait a minute or two for the process to complete, but no manual intervention should be necessary.</p>
