<h2>Backbone Assignment - Tips and Tricks</h2>
<p>Although much of a protein backbone assignment may be easy and straight forward, you can often be left with a few difficult sections and odd gaps to fill in due to poor spectral quality or difficult amino acid sequences (e.g. containing amino acid repeats or proline-rich regions). Here are a few tips, tricks and tools to help you finish off those difficult sections.</p>
<h3>Comments Box</h3>
<p>Use the <span class="action">Comments</span> column in your <span class="action">Backbone Assignment</span> module to make notes on the unassigned residues, e.g. possible assignments or amino acid types.</p>
<h3>Navigate from NmrResidues table</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Reference Chemical Shifts</h3>
<p>If you need a reminder of the standard chemical shifts for amino acids in proteins, open up the <span class="action">Reference Chemical Shift</span> module from the <span class="action">Molecule</span> menu or with <span class="action">RC</span>. This way you can easily check whether the chemical shifts for a particular residue are compatible with certain amino acid types or not.</p>
<h3>Residue Information</h3>
<p>The <span class="action">Residue Information</span> module is also opened via the <span class="action">Molecule</span> menu. This module provides a list of the occurrences of each amino acid type in the sequence, together with the surrounding residues / motifs in which they appear. You can increase the window for the number of neighbouring residues shown. Assigned residues are shown highlighted in green. This is an easy way to find any remaining un-assigned residues of a particular amino acid type and their neighbouring residues.</p>
<h3>Strip Plots from NmrResidues</h3>
<p>Sometimes it is helpful to see the remaining unassigned strips together to see if you can identify any links which were not picked up by the program. An easy way to make a strip plot of NmrResidues of your choice, is to use the <span class="action">Strip Plot</span> function. Select the NmrResidues you want to create a strip plot with (e.g. in the <span class="action">Backbone Assignment</span> module or an NmrResidue Table) and go to <span class="action">Spectrum / Make Strip Plot</span> or type <span class="action">SP</span>. Select the Display you want the strips to be shown in, then select <span class="action">use NmrResidue selection</span> and click <span class="action">OK</span>.
