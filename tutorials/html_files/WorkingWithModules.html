<h2>Working with Modules</h2>
<p>Each window inside the drop area is referred to as a module. A module may contain a spectrum display, a table, a graph or a task module.</p>
<p>Open a module either by <span class="action">right-clicking</span> on an item in the sidebar and selecting <span class="action">Open as Module</span>. This will place the module at a position of the program's choice in the drop area. Alternatively, you can <span class="action">left-drag</span> the data item into the display area. When you place the mouse at the edge of the drop area or an open module you will see a purple box. This indicates the position the new module will be placed. Release your <span class="action">left-drag</span> at the place of your choice to position the new module where you wish it to go. If you wish the new module to span across several modules, place the mouse on the edge of those modules and your pruple box will span the full width of the drop area rather than just the space next to a single module.</p>
<p>Existing modules can be rearranged in a similar manner, but <span class="action">left-dragging</span> and dropping them around the drop area. You can also resize modeules, by <span class="action">left-dragging</span> the side of a module into another.</p>
<p>Spectrum display modules have a defined combination of axes, e.g. HN, HCN, HNC, HHN or similar. You can add and remove spectra to a module which . For information on how to swap the axes of your spectra, see Flipping/Rotating spectra.</p>
