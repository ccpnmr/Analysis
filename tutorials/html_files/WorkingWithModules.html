<h2>Working with Modules</h2>
<p>Each window inside the drop area is referred to as a module. A module may contain a spectrum display, a table, a graph or a task module.</p>
<p>Open a module either by <span class="action">right-clicking</span> on an item in the sidebar and selecting <span class="action">Open as Module</span>. This will place the module at a position of the program's choice in the drop area. Alternatively, you can <span class="action">left-drag</span> the data item into the display area. When you place the mouse at the edge of the drop area or an open module you will see a purple box. This indicates the position where the new module will be placed. Release your <span class="action">left-drag</span> at the place of your choice to position the new module where you wish it to go. If you wish the new module to span across several modules, place the mouse on the edge between those modules and your pruple box will span the full width of the drop area rather than just the space next to a single module.</p>
<p>Existing modules can be rearranged in a similar manner, by <span class="action">left-dragging</span> and dropping them around the drop area. You can also resize modules, by <span class="action">left-dragging</span> the side of one module into another.</p>
<p>Some modules, such as the task modules used for assignment or data analysis, are opened using menu items or keyboard shortcuts. The program will place these modules automatically and you can then place them at the position of your choice afterwards.</p>
<p>Spectrum display modules have a defined combination of axes, e.g. HN, HCN, HNC, HHN etc. You can add or remove any spectrum to/from a module provided the axes match. Note that a 2D HN spectrum can be viewed in an a 3D HNC module, but not a 3D HCN module. For information on how to swap the axes of your spectra, see Flipping/Rotating spectra.</p>
