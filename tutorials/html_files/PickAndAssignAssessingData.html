<h3>Increasing visible z-planes</h3>
<p>Sometimes you may find that the peaks which are picked are in a neighbouring plane to the one you are currently looking at, or indeed in a plane even further away. This makes it difficult to assess quickly whether all the peaks were picked correctly. This may be a particular problem if your spectra have different digital resolutions in the z-dimension or are very highly resolved in the z-dimension. In this case it can be helpful to </p>
