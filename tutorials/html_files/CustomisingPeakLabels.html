<h2>Customising Peak Labels</h2>
<p>You can type <span class="action">PL</span> or go to <span class="action">right-click / Cycle Peak Lables</span> to cycle through four different peak label display options:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><b>Short</b>: Residue Type, Residue Number and Atom Name, compressed where dimensions are the same, e.g. <span class="action">G28H, N</span> or <span class="action">@92H, N</span> or <span class="action">G28H, N; A27CA</span>
<br><b>Full</b>: Residue Type, Residue Number and Atom Name for all dimensions, e.g. <span class="action">G28H, G28N</span> or <span class="action">@92H, @92N</span> or <span class="action">G28H, G28N; A27CA</span>
<br><b>Pid</b>: Project ID (Chain, Residue Number, Residue Type and Atom Name), e.g. <span class="action">A.28.GLY.H, N</span> or <span class="action">@-.@92..H, N</span> or <span class="action">A.28.GLY.H, N; A.ALA.27.CA</span>
<br><b>Minimal</b>: Residue Type and Number, e.g.<span class="action">G28</span> or <span class="action">@92</span> or <span class="action">G28; A27</span></p>
<p>You can set your preferred default peak labels in <span class="action">Project / Preferences</span> (or type <span class="action">Ctrl/Cmd ,</span>) in the <span class="action">Spectrum</span> tab under <span class="action">Peak Annotations</span>.</p>
<p>Peak symbols can be changed by typing <span class="action">PS</span> or going to <span class="action">right-click / Cycle Peak Symbols</span>. Again there are four options which you can cycle through:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><b>Cross</b>: <span class="action">X</span>
<br><b>Line widths</b>: these are drawn as closed ellipses if the line width has been determined or dotted ellipses if the line width is unknown.
<br><b>Filled line widths</b>: there are drawn as filled ellipses if the line width has been determined or flower/star-style ellipses if the line width is unknown.
<br><b>Plus</b>: <span class="action">+</span> </p>
<p>Again, your preferred default peak symbol can be set in <span class="action">Project / Preferences</span> (or type <span class="action">Ctrl/Cmd ,</span>) in the <span class="action">Spectrum</span> tab under <span class="action">Symbols</span>.</p>
<p>The colour of both the peak labels and the peak symbols of a peak list can be changed (independently) by <span class="action">double-clicking</span> on a peak list in the sidebar to bring up the <span class="action">Peak List Properties</span> dialog.</p>
<p>Peaks can also be hidden/shown by <span class="action">right-clicking</span> on a <span class="action">spectrum button</span> in the <span class="action">Spectrum toolbar</span>. Under <span class="action">Peak Lists</span> you can show/hide one or all of the peak lists associated with that spectrum.</p>
