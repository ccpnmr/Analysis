CCPN Analysis v3
Bitbucket/Git setup

    Instructions for installing CCPN as a developer

    The development files are downloaded and installed by downloading and executing an install-script 'installDevelopment.sh'
    contained in a separate repository on bitbucket.

    If you would like to be a developer please email ccpnmr3@gmail.com
    and we will either send you or give you access to the install script and to the development repository.
    Once you have the script, please follow the instructions below.


    Step 1:
    Make sure you're setup on bitbucket with an ssh key; if you don't have one yet the script will prompt you at
    the appropriate point.

    Step 2:
    Make sure you've configured git correctly:

    git config --global user.name "My Name"
    git config --global user.email "email@address.ac.uk"

    Step 3:
    run ./installDevelopment.sh

    Step 4:
    Now add the following to version control in Pycharm>Preferences>Version Control:

      data
      internal
      src/python/ccpnmodel
      src/python/ccpn/AnalysisAssign
      src/python/ccpn/AnalysisStructure
      src/python/ccpn/AnalysisScreen
      src/python/ccpn/AnalysisMetabolomics
      src/python/ccpn/util/nef

    Finally make sure to turn off the Control repositories synchronously option in Pycharm>Preferences>Version Control>Git
