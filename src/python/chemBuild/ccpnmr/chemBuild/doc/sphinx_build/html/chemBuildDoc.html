<h1>Program Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#program-documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Main program documentation for CcpNmr ChemBuild, the CCPN chemical structure
creation program. The graphical interface to CcpNmr ChemBuild is constructed of
five main areas, which are described below.</p>
<div class="section" id="main-menu">
<h2>Main Menu<a class="headerlink" href="#main-menu" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The main menu at the top of the interface reproduces many of the functions that
are available in the toolbars, albeit in a named manner, also handles import
and export of chemical file formats.</p>
<div class="section" id="file">
<h3>File<a class="headerlink" href="#file" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The File menu contains options to load and save native ChemBuild format files.
At present these are .pickle files (Python cPickle dumps of the ChemBuild
internal model). Saving compounds as native ChemBuild files will not result in
any information loss, unlike other formats which may support only a subset of
the data. Other file formats are handled by the Import and Export options.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="import">
<h3>Import<a class="headerlink" href="#import" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>These options allow the import of several chemical file formats, including CCPN
XML (ChemComp), Molfile (v2000), Mol2 (Sybyl2) and PDB. For CCPN import, any
separate compound variants (e.g. protonation or polymer link states) will be
loaded. For the other formats only one chemical structure will be loaded (even
if the format supports several).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="export">
<h3>Export<a class="headerlink" href="#export" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The current compound may be exported as various textual chemical file formats
or as a bitmap image. If the compound has several different variant forms, with
slightly different atoms, these will all be saved when using CCPN XML. For the
other formats however only the currently displayed chemical structure version
will be exported.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="edit">
<h3>Edit<a class="headerlink" href="#edit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This menu reproduces some of the compound editing functionality that is also
present in the toolbars. These are described in more detail in the toolbars
section below. It is notable that atom selections can be cut and pasted using
the regular keyboard selections.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="view">
<h3>View<a class="headerlink" href="#view" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>These options control what is seen in the central graphical compound display.
These options are also available in the toolbars and are described fully there.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="top-toolbars">
<h2>Top Toolbars<a class="headerlink" href="#top-toolbars" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The top toolbars provide graphical elements that the user can click to
manipulate the compound and its display. On most platforms the individual
toolbars may be re-arranged within the main window (or pulled off entirely) by
dragging (click, hold &amp; drag) the left hand edge of the toolbar to a new
location. Also, individual toolbars may be toggled on and off entirely by using
the context menu; usually accessed with a right mouse click over a toolbar.</p>
<div class="section" id="file-toolbar">
<h3>File Toolbar<a class="headerlink" href="#file-toolbar" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The File toolbar contains options to load and save or start a new compound.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="new" class="align-bottom" src="_images/new.png" /> Create a new, blank compound specification, saving the previous one where</dt>
<dd>appropriate.</dd>

</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="edit-toolbar">
<h3>Edit Toolbar<a class="headerlink" href="#edit-toolbar" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>These options perform potentially large-scale editing or transformation of the
current compound. If the current compound has several variant forms all forms
will be edited in a likewise manner, assuming they contain the appropriate
atoms.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="edit-copy" class="align-bottom" src="_images/edit-copy.png" /> Copy the currently highlighted (green border) atom selection into a</dt>
<dd>memory cache (&#8216;clipboard&#8217;) so that the atoms may be pasted into the
compound elsewhere.</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="edit-cut" class="align-bottom" src="_images/edit-cut.png" /> Remove the current atom selection (green border) and copy it into a</dt>
<dd>memory cache so that it may be pasted elsewhere.</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="edit-paste" class="align-bottom" src="_images/edit-paste.png" /> Paste the currently cached atom selection in to the main compound</dt>
<dd>display at the correct cursor location. It should be notated that
atom names may change from their original values if there are
duplications.</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="edit-undo" class="align-bottom" src="_images/edit-undo.png" /> Undo the last user operations, restoring the compound to previous states.</dt>
<dd>Only the last 10 states can be restored.</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="add-hydrogen" class="align-bottom" src="_images/add-hydrogen.png" /> Add hydrogen atoms to any unsatisfied valences (black dots). If</dt>
<dd>a subset of atoms is selected then only these will be
considered. Otherwise if nothing is selected all atoms will be
considered. Hydrogens will be named according to the heavy atom
that they bond to.</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="delete-atom" class="align-bottom" src="_images/delete-atom.png" /> Delete the currently selected atoms (green border). Note that if</dt>
<dd>all the atoms within a given variant form are deleted that whole
version of the compound will be removed, but the other forms will
remain.</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="delete-bond" class="align-bottom" src="_images/delete-bond.png" /> Delete the bonds that belong to the currently selected atoms. If</dt>
<dd>only one atom is selected then all of its bonds will be deleted.
If multiple atoms are selected then only the bonds that go
between selected atoms will be deleted. For example to delete
only one bond select the two atoms it lies between.</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="object-rotate-left" class="align-bottom" src="_images/object-rotate-left.png" /> Rotate the current atom selection, or the whole compound</dt>
<dd>if nothing is selected, anticlockwise about its centre.</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="object-rotate-right" class="align-bottom" src="_images/object-rotate-right.png" /> Rotate the current atom selection, or the whole compound</dt>
<dd>if nothing is selected, clockwise about its centre.</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="object-flip-horizontal" class="align-bottom" src="_images/object-flip-horizontal.png" /> Flip the current atom selection, or the whole compound</dt>
<dd>if nothing is selected, horizontally (left becomes
right) about its centre.</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="object-flip-vertical" class="align-bottom" src="_images/object-flip-vertical.png" /> Flip the current atom selection, or the whole compound</dt>
<dd>if nothing is selected, vertically (top becomes bottom)
about its centre.</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="auto-arrange" class="align-bottom" src="_images/auto-arrange.png" /> Automatically arrange the currently selected atoms, or all atoms</dt>
<dd>if none are selected, to minimise atom overlap and optimise bond
length, thus giving a neater graphical display. If the compound
gets stuck in strange conformations the user may move selected
atoms to better positions before arranging again.</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="auto-bond" class="align-bottom" src="_images/auto-bond.png" /> Automatically adds bonds to any free valences (black dots) in the</dt>
<dd>current atom selection, or the whole compound if nothing is
selected. Bonds will be added to the closest available pair of
atoms first and will continue linking pairs until the bond length
becomes significantly longer than the first bond added. The user
should be careful to place atoms in appropriate locations prior to
using this option. In general small rings are avoided and using
this option several times will add progressively more bonds if
there are still free sites (although this may make a mess).</dd>

<h3>Properties Toolbar<a class="headerlink" href="#properties-toolbar" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Aromatic</strong></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="toggle-aromatic" class="align-bottom" src="_images/toggle-aromatic.png" /> Sets the selected atoms to be part of an aromatic ring. Note</dt>
<dd>that this function does not yet check the sanity of such a
specification. If a selected atom is already aromatic the
aromatic ring will be removed. It does not matter which atom
or atoms within a given ring are selected.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>Charge</strong></p>
<p>These options set the unit charge on atoms (+/- electron equivalents). Note
that there is currently no notion of partial or delocalised charges within
ChemBuild.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="charge-pos" class="align-bottom" src="_images/charge-pos.png" /> Sets the charge of the currently selected atoms to be positive. If</dt>
<dd>an atom already has a positive charge the charge is made more
positive. The appropriate extra valance slots will be added to the
atom for bonding, e.g. [N+] will have four bonding slots.</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="charge-none" class="align-bottom" src="_images/charge-none.png" />  Sets the currently selected atoms to have no charge. This resets</dt>
<dd>the valance bonding slots to the uncharged state.</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="charge-neg" class="align-bottom" src="_images/charge-neg.png" /> Sets the charge of the currently selected atoms to be negative. If</dt>
<dd>an atom is already negatively charged the charge will become more
negative. The appropriate number of valance slots will be removed,
e.g. [O-] will have only one bonding slot.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>Valence</strong></p>
<p>These options control how many bonds and atom may have. Under most
circumstances the valence bonding slots do not need to be changed from the
starting values, but adjustments are useful for different redox states.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="valence-add" class="align-bottom" src="_images/valence-add.png" /> Adds an extra valence bonding slot to the currently selected</dt>
<dd>atoms. It is currently up to the user to create chemically sane
bonding states. This option can be used to create different
covalently bound redox states, e.g. sulfur has two slots to start
with but more can be added to make sulfates.</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="valence-remove" class="align-bottom" src="_images/valence-remove.png" /> Remove a valence bonding slot. It is currently up to the user</dt>
<dd>to create chemically sane bonding states. This option is
useful for creating different covalently bound oxidation
states.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>Chirality</strong></p>
<p>These options set stereochemistry labels for atom centres. These options will
be expanded in the future.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="stereo-R" class="align-bottom" src="_images/stereo-R.png" /> Set the currently selected atoms to be an &#8220;R&#8221; chiral centre. It</dt>
<dd>should noted that this is a user label and no checks of IUPAC rules
are made. Some basic sanity checks are made to ensure that an atom
has enough bonded neighbours.</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="stereo-S" class="align-bottom" src="_images/stereo-S.png" /> Set the currently selected atoms to be an &#8220;S&#8221; chiral centre. It</dt>
<dd>should noted that this is a user label and no checks of IUPAC rules
are made. Some basic sanity checks are made to ensure that an atom
has enough bonded neighbours.</dd>
</dl>
<p><img align="bottom" alt="stereo-none" class="align-bottom" src="_images/stereo-none.png" /> remove any chirality labels from the selected atoms</p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p>These options are used to specify how a compound may be linked as a residue
within a (bio)polymer chain (protein, nucleic acid, saccharide). A link is
added to a compound by replacing selected atoms with a special &#8216;link&#8217; atom,
which indicates where an adjacent residue is located. Usually the links replace
hydroxyl groups or hydrogen atoms and effectively represent the dehydration
ration that occurs when bio-polymer residues are joined. For example in protein
amino acids links are made that replace the OH of the carboxylate group and a
hydrogen of the amine group. Adding a link will create several different
versions of the current compound, i.e. linked and unlinked variant forms. A
typical bio-polymer residue will have at least four linked forms: &#8220;none&#8221; for
the free compound, &#8220;start&#8221; for the first residue in a chain (e.g. N-terminal or
5&#8217;), &#8220;end&#8221; for the last residue in the chain (e.g. C-terminal or 3&#8217;) and
&#8220;middle&#8221; for a internal residues. Some residues may also have extra link
states, such as disulfide linked cysteine. Where there is no distinct beginning
or end to a chain, i.e. for oligosaccharides, then generic links may still be
added.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="link-prev" class="align-bottom" src="_images/link-prev.png" /> This option replaces the currently selected H or OH to create a</dt>
<dd>compound variant that links to the previous residue in the
bio-polymer chain (following normal conventions, to N-terminus or
5&#8217; end). The unlinked version of the compound will not be removed
and is still available.</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="link-next" class="align-bottom" src="_images/link-next.png" /> This option replaces the currently selected H or OH to create a</dt>
<dd>compound variant that links to the next residue in the bio-polymer
chain (following normal conventions, to C-terminus or 3&#8217; end). The
unlinked version of the compound is available and will not be
removed.</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="link" class="align-bottom" src="_images/link.png" /> This option replaces the currently selected H or OH to create a compound</dt>
<dd>variant that links to another residue. The link will be named after the
atoms it connects. E.g. adding a side chain link to cysteine will create
an &#8220;SG&#8221; (sulfur gamma) link. The unlinked version of the compound is
available and will not be removed.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>Exchange</strong></p>
<p>These options are used to determine whether hydrogen atoms can exchange in
aqueous solution, ether resulting in different protonation forms, depending on
pH, or in atom sites that are not normally observed in NMR.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="variable-atom" class="align-bottom" src="_images/variable-atom.png" /> The currently selected hydrogen atom is set to be variable; it</dt>
<dd>is present in some forms of the compound but not others. This
results in different protonation states of the compound, i.e.
with and without the hydrogen, and all forms can be selected
(unless they have been deliberately deleted). Setting a
variable hydrogen means the group it is attached to is acidic
or basic. For example the H in carboxylic acids can be set as
variable to give anion and neutral forms. Likewise an H in
-NH3+ can be set as variable to give a neutral form. As far as
NMR assignment is concerned it is up to the user to choose the
appropriate form (dependant on pKa and pH), but several forms
can be present in the same compound description.</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="exchange-hydrogen" class="align-bottom" src="_images/exchange-hydrogen.png" /> The currently selected hydrogen is deemed to be in &#8216;fast</dt>
<dd>exchange&#8217; with a protic solvent. This setting means that
the atom is unlikely to be observed in an NMR experiment.
Typical examples include hydrogens in the hydroxyl groups
of serine and threonine. The bond to such a hydrogen is
displayed as a dashed line in the main display. This option
should not be used for a typical protein backbone amide,
which may be exchangeable, but is normally observable by
NMR.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>NMR Groups</strong></p>
<p>These options are used to connect several atoms of the same kind (usually
hydrogens or carbons) into a grouping that has a special meaning for NMR
resonance assignment. There are two kinds of groups that may be specified;
magnetically equivalent and non-stereo. The first means that the atoms are
rapidly changing locations so that all atoms in the group see the same magnetic
environment and have the same chemical shift. This is usually the case for the
hydrogens in methyl groups and rotationally symmetric positions in aromatic
rings. The second group, which is often used for prochiral hydrogens, means
that there are two atoms that are stereochemically distinct, but which cannot
initially be distinguished in an NMR experiment (without the aid of structure
calculations).</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="nmr-equivalent" class="align-bottom" src="_images/nmr-equivalent.png" /> The currently selected atoms (of the same kind) are deemed to</dt>
<dd>be magnetically equivalent and have the same chemical shift.
This kind of grouping is automatically made for methyls, but
may be added for other situations, for example delta positions
in the aromatic ring of Phenylalanine have equivalent carbons
and equivalent hydrogens under most circumstances (where the
ring flips).</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="nmr-prochiral" class="align-bottom" src="_images/nmr-prochiral.png" /> The currently selected pair of atoms, or pair of NMR equivalent</dt>
<dd>groups (e.g. methyls) are set to be a non-stereo group. There
will usually be two distinct chemical shifts, but it will not
be possible to unambiguously assign the stereochemistry, at
least initially. This grouping is automatically added for
methylene groups but may also be added in other situations. For
example the two methyl groups in Valine; pairing the two gamma
carbons and the two sets of methyl hydrogens.</dd>
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="nmr-no-group" class="align-bottom" src="_images/nmr-no-group.png" /> Removes all NMR grouping specification that may be present for</dt>
<dd>the selected atoms. Note that whole groups are deleted,
irrespective of whether all of the group&#8217;s atoms were selected.</dd>

main window.</p>
<div class="section" id="elements">
<h3>Elements<a class="headerlink" href="#elements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This section contains a list of the chemical elements commonly found in
covalently bonded compounds. They may be added to the current molecule via
drag-and-drop to the central area: clicking and holding the mouse cursor on an
element, moving to the desired location in the compound and then releasing. The
common &#8216;organic&#8217; elements H, C, N, O, P and S may be added to a compound simply
by pressing the corresponding key on the keyboard; the atom will be added at

<h3>Compound and Fragment Library<a class="headerlink" href="#compound-and-fragment-library" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This cascading tree panel categorises several types of molecular fragment that
may be added to the current compound. Clicking on a category or sub-category
opens lists of compounds and fragments. These may be added to the current
compound by drag-and-drop; the user grabs the compound name and releases it at
the appropriate location in the central compound display (the view may
re-centre). The fragment may need to be further modified or linked to other
atoms. Some fragments, such as <em>carboxylic acid</em>, <em>amine</em> and the amino acid
<em>linked template</em> are pre-constructed with different compound forms. For
example adding a carboxylic acid will give both protonated an unprotonated
forms.</p>

main window.</p>
<div class="section" id="variant-forms">
<h3>Variant Forms<a class="headerlink" href="#variant-forms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The drop-down menus in this section allow the user to switch the compound
display between any of the variant forms of the compound (should any exist).
Different variants are not constructed as separate entities, rather they appear
automatically whenever residue links or variable atoms (i.e. protonation
states) are added to a compound.</p>
<p><strong>Protonation</strong></p>
<p>This drop-down menu allows selection of the different protonation forms of a
compound, according to the hydrogen atoms that are present or absent. The
states that are available will be restricted to only the current polymer
linking (see below). For example the N-terminal &#8220;start&#8221; variant of the amino
acid alanine will have the amide protonation states listed, but not the
carboxylate states; these are only present for the C-terminal &#8220;end&#8221; variant.
Likewise a &#8220;middle&#8221; linked alanine will only have one neutral protonation
state.</p>
<p><strong>Polymer Linking</strong></p>
<p>This menu selects the current variant of the compound to display according to
the linear bio-polymer linking state, if any such links exist. The available
states are &#8220;start&#8221;, &#8220;middle&#8221;, &#8220;end&#8221; and &#8220;none&#8221; to represent the different forms
within a chain and the free, unlinked form. For a compound to have such entries
requires that it has previous (&#8220;-1&#8221;) and next (&#8220;+1&#8221;) residue links defined by
replacing certain atoms compared to the unlinked variant. A given kind of
linking may be combined with other variations, selected in the other menus. For
example &#8220;middle&#8221; lysine has protonated and unprotonated side chain forms.</p>
<p><strong>Other links</strong></p>
<p>This drop-down menu lists any variants caused by the presence of links other
than those for standard linear bio-polymers. These include crosslinks in
proteins, e.g. disulfide linked cysteine, and links in non-linear or branching
chains, e.g. oligosaccharides. For sugar rings these links may be numerous
given that there may be multiple combinations of different links. For example
glucose can have [1,3], [1,4], [1,6], [1,4,6] links etc.</p>
<p><strong>Stereochemistry</strong></p>
<p>This selects stereochemical form of a compound to display, e.g. alpha- or beta-
glucose. Note that this option is little used until the chirality and
stereochemistry capabilities of ChemBuild are improved.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><img align="bottom" alt="checkbox" class="align-bottom" src="_images/checkbox.png" /> <em>Default form</em>: sets whether the currently viewed form of a compound</dt>
<dd>is the default version, within the selected bio-polymer linking. For
example the default version of lysine has a protonated side chain.
Setting this is useful when exporting to CCPN because the default
variant will be the one included as standard when building
molecules. The other forms will still be available but require extra
settings.</dd>

<h3>Compound Info<a class="headerlink" href="#compound-info" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Name</strong></p>
<p>A human readable name for the compound. This is separate from any save file
name, but may be present internally within exported chemical files.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong></p>
<p>Comments and further description of the compound and its various forms may be
added. These will be preserved in a CCPN export.</p>
<p><strong>CCPN Code</strong></p>
<p>This sets the &#8220;CcpCode&#8221; for a compound, which is the short identifying code for
a particular type of residue. Typically these will be three-letter codes, e.g
&#8220;His&#8221; or &#8220;ATP&#8221;, but shorter and longer codes are allowed. The purpose of these
residue codes is to provide a short, but meaningful identifier that can be used
when constructing molecules and making NMR resonance assignments. When
exporting to CCPN XML files the code is checked to make sure it is not already
in use, so that there is no confusion with regards to the standard compounds.</p>
<p><strong>CCPN MolType</strong></p>
<p>This sets the molecule type for the compound, as used within CCPN projects. For
most small molecules this should remain as &#8220;other&#8221;. However, if the compound
has the correct link specifications for protein, DNA, RNA or carbohydrate
biomolecules it may use a more appropriate type. Setting protein, DNA or RNA
molecule types will allow the compound to be entered in a standard residue
sequence, using its CcpCode (above).</p>

<h2>Central Compound Display<a class="headerlink" href="#central-compound-display" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The large central area of ChemBuild is where the atoms of a chemical structure
are displayed and assembled. This is where atoms may be moved to create
geometries and connected via bonds. Atoms and compound fragments may be added
by drag-and-drop from the left hand panel, added using a SMILES string or by
using one of the H, C, N, O, P or S keys. Once displayed in the main panel the
atoms may be selected and dragged into position. It should be noted that only
one version of a compound will be displayed at a time. If there are other
variants, for example protonation states, then these maybe accessed using the
drop-down menus in the right-hand panel. For the most part changing the atoms
in one compound variant will affect all of the other variants, as long as the
change is valid. For example when moving an atom it is moved in all the variant
forms it is found within.</p>
<p>When two atoms with free valence slots are moved close the black valence
circles will turn green. If the atom is then released a new bond will be formed
between the two highlighted valence slots, joining the atoms. This may be
repeated to form double or triple bonds. Alternatively, atoms may be quickly
bonded, if first placed in appropriate positions, by using the <em>auto bond</em>
option described above. Also, the <em>auto arrange</em> function removes the need to
spend significant time arranging atoms once they are bonded. The properties of
the selected atoms, such as charge and aromaticity, may be set by selecting the
appropriate option from the toolbars or menus.</p>
<p>The general mouse-driven controls that are used to build a compound are
described below.</p>
<div class="section" id="mouse-controls">
<h3>Mouse Controls<a class="headerlink" href="#mouse-controls" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Left-click on an atom</strong>: selects an individual atom.</p>
<p><strong>Left-click on an atom plus &lt;Control&gt;</strong>: toggles atoms to add to, or remove
from, the current selection.</p>
<p><strong>Double left-click on an atom</strong>: selects the whole fragment, following bonds
from the current atom.</p>
<p><strong>Left-click and drag in free space</strong>: draws a green box that is used to select
atoms.</p>
<p><strong>Left-click and drag on an atom</strong>: moves the currently selected atom or atoms,
following the mouse cursor.</p>
<p><strong>Double left-click on a bond</strong>: if there are free valence slots, this toggles
the bond type through single, double, triple and quadruple.</p>
<p><strong>Double left-click on an atom name</strong>: opens a box to edit the name of an atom.</p>
<p><strong>Middle-click on a bond</strong>: toggles single, double, triple and quadruple bond
types.</p>
<p><strong>Middle-wheel</strong>: zooms the display, making the atoms appear larger or smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Middle-click and drag</strong>: if scrollbars are displayed this pans the whole
display area.</p>
<p><strong>Right-click</strong>: opens a context menu, where many of the options already
described for the toolbars are available.</p>
