Obtaining CcpNmr ChemBuild
==========================

CcpNmr ChemBuild may be downloaded from the main CCPN site at
`http://www.ccpn.ac.uk/download/`_. New releases will be available from the
same location. ChemBuild will also be included in the CcpNmr Analysis release
from version 3.0.

Installing and Running ChemBuild
================================

To install ChemBuild simply download the .tgz archive and unpack into your
desired location::

  tar -xvzf ChemBuild.tgz

ChemBuild requires that Python and the PySide module (Qt bindings) are
installed. The PySide module may be downloaded via the following link:
`http://www.pyside.org/downloads/`_. For many linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu,
Fedora, SUSE etc) it is probably easiest to install PySide using the local
package management system.

To start CcpNmr ChemBuild, navigate to its installation directory and issue::

  python ChemBuild.py

Alternatively you can command line setup aliases so that the command
'chembuild' can be run from anywhere. For example a .bashrc file might
contain::

  export CHEM_BUILD_PATH='/home/user/chemBuild'
  alias chembuild='python $CHEM_BUILD_PATH/ChemBuild.py'
